SQL is a standard language for storing, manipulating and retrieving data in databases. SQL stands for Structured Query Language. 

RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System. RDBMS is the basis of SQL, and for all modern database systems such as MS SQL Server, MySQL, and Microsoft Access. The data in RDBMS is stored in database objects called tables. A table is a collection of related data entries and it consists of columns and rows. 

Every table is broken up into smaller entities called fields. A field is a column in a table that is designed to maintain specific information about every record in the table. A record, also called a row, is each individual entry that exists in a table. A record is a horizontal entry in a table. 

A column is a vertical entity in a table that contains all information associated with a specific field in a table.
